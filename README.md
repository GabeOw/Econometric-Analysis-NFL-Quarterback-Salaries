# An Econometric Analysis on NFL Quarterback Salaries

### Methodology

#### Techniques Used:

- The study employs regression analysis to investigate the determinants of NFL quarterback salaries. Econometric models are developed to understand how various independent variables influence the dependent variable (quarterback salary).
- Multiple regression models are tested, including linear and logarithmic transformations of the dependent variable to assess the relationship dynamics more accurately.
- Variable selection is guided by theory and previous research, focusing on both performance-related statistics (e.g., completion percentage, touchdowns, total yards) and demographic factors (e.g., age).

#### Model Selection Criteria:

- The best-fitting model is chosen based on several criteria, including the Adjusted R-square value for model explanatory power, and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Schwarz Criterion (BIC), and Hannan-Quinn Criterion (HQC) for model complexity and fit.
- Diagnostic tests are conducted to check for multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), heteroskedasticity, and model specification errors (Ramsey RESET test).

### Results

#### Key Findings:

- The final model demonstrates that age, completion percentage (CMP), quarterback rating (QBR), total touchdowns (TD), and total yards (YDS) positively influence quarterback salaries, while total interceptions (INT) have a negative impact.
- Age shows a nonlinear relationship with salary, suggesting experience values differently across a quarterback's career.
- Performance metrics like touchdowns and total yards have significant positive impacts on salary, underscoring the market's valuation of offensive productivity.
- The quarterback rating (QBR), a comprehensive performance measure, also plays a crucial role in determining salary, indicating teams' emphasis on overall effectiveness rather than just traditional stats.
- The presence of multicollinearity, especially among variables representing different aspects of performance, suggests some caution in interpreting individual coefficients.

### Discussion

#### Interpretation of Findings:

- The positive relationship between age and salary up to a certain point reflects the NFL's premium on experience, likely due to its correlation with leadership and game management skills. However, the diminishing or negative returns after a peak age indicate a preference for youth as teams balance experience with physical decline.
- The significant positive effects of touchdowns and total yards on salaries highlight the emphasis on quarterbacks' ability to contribute directly to scoring and to move the ball, critical aspects of winning games.
- The negative impact of interceptions on salaries emphasizes risk aversion in quarterback play. Teams penalize quarterbacks for turnovers, which can drastically change the course of a game.
- The complexity of quarterback performance evaluation is evident in the importance of the QBR metric, which attempts to isolate the quarterback's contribution from the team's performance. Its significance suggests teams value a quarterback's efficiency and decision-making in varied play contexts.

#### Broader Implications:

- The findings provide empirical support for the strategic valuation of quarterbacks in the NFL labor market. Teams prioritize not just the statistical outputs but also the qualitative aspects of quarterback play, such as decision-making and efficiency under pressure.
- For quarterbacks and their agents, these insights can inform contract negotiations, highlighting the importance of performance metrics beyond traditional statistics.
- The study underscores the complex interplay between a quarterback's salary and his performance, experience, and the strategic needs of the team, offering a nuanced understanding of NFL quarterback valuation.
